 * When stability of the result has reached the desired level,
 * the service may be stopped by calling the -stopTasks method.

 * @param resultStatus The estimate of how stable the result is.
 *      It may go up and down. It is not guaranteed that it ever reaches desired levels for a particular scene.
 *      For a list of possible values see the RTRResultStabilityStatus constant descriptions.
